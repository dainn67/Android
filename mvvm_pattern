MVVM: Model View Viewmodel
- A better model to adapt to the new Microsoft development platform than MVC and MVP

+ Model: contains data and handle logics (business logic)

+ View: the interface of the software to display data and interact with users (View in this pattern can respond back to users using binding and command)

+ ViewModel: the middle layer between View and Model, handles the data formatting, binding and command
