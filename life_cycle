# Lifecycle of an Activity:

- onCreate() :
  + Triggered when the activity is first created, on activityCreation, the activity enters CREATED state
  + In this method, initial and basic logic should be performed
  
- onStart() :
  + Triggered when the activity enter Started state
  + The activity now becomes visible to user
  + When the activity is created, the app enter RESUMED state
  
- onResume() :
  + When the activity enters Resumed state, it comes to Foreground, and can now be interacted by user
  + The activity will turn to onPause if it is not focused on (another phone call, screen turns off, ...)
  
- onPause() :
  + If users leave the activity, it comes to onPause, not destroyed and still visible in Multi-window
  
- onStop() :
  + If the activity can't be seen by users, it enters onStop() (Eg: when a new activity shows up, user presses Home)
  
- onDestroy() :
  + When the activity is finished using completely, onDestroy is called, terminate the activity and can not be resumed
